This isn't safe to use, but if you must, please use something like dnsmasq or lots of
`hosts` editing to point `*.xssrc` to `127.0.0.1`. locally. The fallback hosts are only
meant for my personal use, and I may change their DNS configuration at any time.

This should store persistent logs on all machines invovled. It is not to be unnoticed.
